title: Query & Index Plugins

As Dicoogle is an archive, the means of indexing and retrieving information are important. Rather than being restricted to a specific database management system, Dicoogle can be extended to support different technologies for storing DICOM meta-data, and sometimes even processed data. This is achieved with the Query and Index plugin pair, which usually go hand-in-hand:

- **Indexer plugins** (also called indexing or just index plugins) take incoming requests for indexing objects and processes it for future retrieval.
- **Query plugins** interpret queries from the user and return lists of results based on that query.
